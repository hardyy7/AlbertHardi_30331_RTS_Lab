Ex 4:	In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) 
		that objects of that class will have.

Ex 5: 	A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. Its primary purpose is to
		initialize the newly created object by assigning initial values to its fields or performing any necessary setup tasks. In short, a constructor helps 
		prepare an object for use.	
		
Ex 6:	In Java, there are four types of access modifiers:

		1. public: Allows unrestricted access from any other class or package.
		2. protected: Allows access from within the same package or subclasses.
		3. default (no modifier): Allows access only from within the same package.,
		4. private: Restricts access to only within the same class.
